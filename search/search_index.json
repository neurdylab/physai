Dynamic characteristics of the body's physiology, such as changes in breathing and cardiac activity, provide windows into health and disease as well as critical functions such as cognition and emotion. Monitoring the body\u2019s physiology during fMRI experiments is also vital for the precision and interpretation of fMRI studies, since variations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals are closely linked with autonomic physiological processes. </p> <p>Broadly, PhysAI investigates relationships between peripheral physiological signals and brain-wide hemodynamics measured with fMRI. Since many fMRI datasets do not contain concurrent physiological measures, a major goal is to develop machine learning techniques for extracting key aspects of physiological dynamics directly from fMRI data, aiming to enrich existing fMRI datasets with missing physiological information. Further, we are developing techniques to address substantial practical challenges arising from the need to carefully inspect and clean recorded physiological data prior to its use in fMRI or with other neurotechnologies.

Natural fluctuations in the body's physiology, such as breathing and heart rate, provide windows into one's health as well as critical functions such as cognition and emotion. In addition, physiological changes can heavily influence fMRI signals. As such, incorporating measurements of the body\u2019s physiology into the analysis of fMRI data can substantially increase both the richness and interpretation of fMRI studies. To address this gap, we are developing frameworks for inferring continuous variations in respiration amplitude and heart rate directly from whole-brain fMRI dynamics.

Our main model was developed using resting-state fMRI data. However, we also developed a model that was trained on task data in order to assess brain-state dependency, ensuring that the inferred signals are contextually relevant. In addition to model development, this work carries out a meticulous assessment of the utility of the predicted signals, the performance under various conditions, and the interpretability of the model.</p> <p>The resulting tool aims to enrich neuroimaging datasets by reconstructing missing or corrupted physiological data directly from fMRI data, and is specifically tailored for the young adult (~ 22-35 years old) population.</p> <p><p> </p></p> <p>The pipeline for estimating respiration volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) signals from fMRI time-series dynamics is shown.

ROI time-series signals are extracted from the fMRI volumes, detrended, bandpass filtered and downsampled. The preprocessed signals are provided to a candidate network as input channels.

Recognizing this, neuroimaging research increasingly draws upon concurrent recordings of peripheral physiology to enhance fMRI analysis. However, the usefulness of physiological data is contingent upon the quality of the recordings as well as expertise in data handling. Not only is quality assessment a tedious process, but the assessments can also vary significantly between raters. While there are manual and template-based tools for assessing peak detection quality (physiopy\u2019s peakdet, PhysIO, etc.), and automated exclusion criteria based on statistical summary metrics, we are not aware of automated approaches that can provide a rapid, effective determination of quality on the whole-scan or windowed level.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"projects/qa/#manual-qa","title":"Manual QA","text":"<p>REPO </p> <p>We are working on designing a manual quality assessment tool for physiological data.

These files can be downloaded from the provided OSF link: OSF Dataset.</p> <p>(Optional) Download the data directly from the URL to your local file path:</p> <pre><code>import requests\n</code></pre> <pre><code>def download_file(url, file_path):\n    \"\"\"Download a file from a web URL to a local file path.\"\"\"\n    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:\n            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n                file.write(chunk)\n        print(f\"Downloaded {file_path}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download from {url}\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code># URLs to the dataset files\nbase_url = \"https://osf.io/z8yph/download\"\ninput_url = f\"{base_url}?filename=cardiac_input.pkl\"\nlabel_url = f\"{base_url}?filename=cardiac_label.pkl\"\n\n\n# File paths where the data will be saved\ninput_file_path = \"cardiac_input.pkl\"\nlabel_file_path = \"cardiac_label.pkl\"\n\n\n# Download the files\ndownload_file(input_url, input_file_path)\ndownload_file(label_url, label_file_path)\n</code></pre> <p>Load the data: <pre><code>with open('cardiac_input.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n    x = pickle.load(file)\n\nwith open('cardiac_label.pkl', 'rb') as file:\n    y = pickle.load(file)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Clean the data: Remove any samples with NaN labels, which represent missing or undefined labels. <pre><code>nanmask = np.isnan(y)\nx = x[~nanmask]\ny = y[~nanmask]\n</code></pre></p> Step 4: Define and Train the Model <p>You will use a 1D CNN, which is suitable for time-series and sequence data like cardiac signals.</p> <p>Setup cross-validation: Use 5-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well across different subsets of your data. <pre><code>kfold = KFold(n_splits=5)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Define the model: Use multiple convolutional layers to capture the hierarchical pattern in the data. <pre><code>model = Sequential([\n    layers.Conv1D(64, kernel_size=5, strides=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)),\n    layers.Conv1D(32, 5, 3, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Conv1D(16, 5, 3, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Conv1D(8, 5, 3, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Flatten(),\n    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n])\n</code></pre></p> <p>Compile and fit the model:Use the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. <pre><code>model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n</code></pre></p> <p>Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model on the test set. <pre><code>history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=25, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=2, callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)])\n</code></pre></p> Step 5: Results and Visualization: <p>Plot the training history and display the accuracy and loss metrics to evaluate the model performance: <pre><code>plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])\nplt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])\nplt.title('Model Accuracy')\nplt.ylabel('Accuracy')\nplt.xlabel('Epoch')\nplt.legend(['Train', 'Validation'], loc='upper left')\nplt.show()\n</code></pre></p> <p>This tutorial outlines how to setup, process data, train, and evaluate a machine learning model using a 1D CNN. Adjust the kernel size, stride, and model architecture based on specific requirements and dataset characteristics to optimize performance.</p>"}]}
