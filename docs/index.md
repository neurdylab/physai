# About

Welcome to PhysAI research suite, which is dedicated to advancing  the analysis of physiological signals alongside human neuroimaging data. Our tools are designed to support researchers in exploring the complex interactions between the brain and body.

Reconstruction methods enable the extraction of low-frequency cardiac and respiratory fluctuations directly from fMRI data. This is particularly valuable when physiological recordings are unavailable or compromised, enriching the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data. 

Quality Assurance Tools include both manual and automated tools for the quality assessment of physiological recordings acquired during MRI sessions.
