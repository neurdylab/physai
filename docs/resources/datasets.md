We are committed to sharing all data related to our project. This will include list of subjects that passed quality assurance and were used in our projects, along with the associated quality assurance code. The data encompass several significant cohorts, such as HCP-YA (yound adult), HCP-A (aging), and NKI-RS (Rockland Sample) datasets, as well as Vanderbilt's internal collections.

Currently, we are in the process of preparing these resources for public release. Please stay tuned for updates as we finalize the preparation and obtain the necessary permissions.


### HCP Young Adult

 | Info      | Details                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| FMRI paradigm | resting-state |
| Physiological measures | respiration (belt) and cardiac (ppg) |
| Criteria | Physiological signals were reported to have passed a quality assessment in both Power et al. (2020)^1^ and Xifra-Porxas et al. (2021)^2^. |
