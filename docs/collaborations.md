# Collaborations

## Open Science and Global Collaborations
Our project is deeply committed to the principles of open science, fostering a collaborative environment where knowledge is shared freely and innovation is driven by collective effort. We actively contribute to and collaborate with open-source projects such as [physiopy](https://github.com/physiopy), where our work not only advances our research but also supports the broader scientific community.

We believe that transparency and accessibility are key to advancing scientific discovery. All our tools, data, and methodologies are openly available, inviting researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to join us in refining and expanding this work. Your contributions—whether it's improving our codebase, sharing your expertise, or providing feedback—are invaluable in pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Together, through open collaboration and shared resources, we can accelerate scientific progress and make a lasting impact. Explore our repositories, contribute to our projects, and join a growing community that's dedicated to making science open and accessible for everyone.
