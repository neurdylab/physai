# Funding

Our work is made possible through the generous support of the BRAIN Initiative, specifically under the NIH grant RF1MH125931. 

We are deeply grateful for this support, which played a crucial role in driving our mission to explore the complexities of the brain and body, and to share our findings with the broader scientific community.
